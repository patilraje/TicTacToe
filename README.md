# TicTacToe


Instructions on How to Run the Game:

Install the game.cpp file, save it, build it and run it. After completing these steps youâ€™re good to go.

Important: The game.cpp can run as a standalone file. All other files are provided in case you want to perform unit testing. The test cases are specified, and testing has passed on my end.

Program details:
Developed and tested on MacOS. Toolchains used: MacOSX GCC

Run time: Constant O(1)

Compatibility testing: The game has been run on VS Code on Windows and also on an online
compiler to verify platform compatibility.

1. Begin by initiating the game. It is designed for two players.
2. The first player will register by entering their name when prompted.
3. After registering, the first player will be prompted to select their symbol for the game. This symbol will represent their moves on the game grid.
4. Following the selection of the symbol by the first player, the second player will be prompted to enter their name.
5. Upon entering their name, the second player will be automatically assigned the remaining symbol that the first player did not choose.
6. With both players registered and symbols assigned, the game grid will be displayed.
7. The first player will commence the game by selecting a row on the grid, followed by a column where they wish to place their symbol.
8. After the first player's move, the second player will take their turn. They must select an available row and column to place their symbol.
9. Each player takes turns making moves until one player achieves victory or the game ends in a draw.
10. Players must ensure fair play throughout the game by selecting only available blocks on the grid. If a block is already occupied, it is not a valid move.
11. Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!
    
Unit Testing
Unit testing has been conducted and has passed all test cases, the commands for unit testing have been commented out so game.cpp can run as a stand alone program, but if you were to run unit testing, you must download the test.h, test.cpp and game.h.
